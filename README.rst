Pip4Blender
===========

Overview
--------

This is a Blender Add-on which enables support for using pip (the standard
Python Package Manager) from within Blender.

Blender utilizes a bundled Python implementation, which does not include pip.  Because
of this, it is actually quite difficult to install third-party libraries and packages
into the Blender Python Implementation.  Pip4Blender makes this just as easy as
installing normal add-ons.

Features
--------
* Install Pip into the Blender Python installation from the Blender UI
* Use pip to install specific libraries from the Blender UI
* Import requirements.txt files from the Blender UI
