Getting Started
===============

Installing a Library with Pip
-----------------------------

Now that the add-on is installed, we can use it to install any Python package
available over pip.  This is done by specifying the package name, then using the
'Install Python Library' button:

For example, if we type 'requests' into the text box shown above, then hit the button,
we would install the Requests module into Blender's Python installation with pip.

Installing a Requirements File with Pip
---------------------------------------

If you have been provided with a requirements.txt file, often along with an add-on
you wish to install, you can hit the 'Install Requirements File' button, and select
the file in the browser that opens up:

This will install all dependent packages specified in the requirements file to
your Blender installation.
